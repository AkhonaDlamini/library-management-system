#Task 1 A: 
#Suppose you use the system to add a book titled "Python Programming" written by Jacob Zuma with a 
#book_id of 2024001, and a member named Anelisa Maleka with a member_id of 1. How would these 
#additions reflect in the books and members lists, and what would the output look like if you printed 
#both lists immediately after these additions? 
#Hint: call the functions and write a print statement for them

books = []
members = []

# The system features two functions (You must create these functions): add_book and add_member. The add_book 
#function takes three parameters (book_id, title, author, status) and appends a new book dictionary to 
#the books list. The add_member function, on the other hand, requires two parameters (member_id, 
#name) and appends a new member dictionary to the members list. 

def add_book(book_id,title,author,status):

    books.append({
        'Book ID':book_id,
        'Book Title':title,
        'Book Author':author,
        'Book Status':status
    })

    return books
#Each member dictionary includes an empty list for borrowed_books to track the IDs of books each member has borrowed.
def add_member(member_id,name):

    members.append({
        'Member ID':member_id,
        'Member Name':name,
        'borrowed_books':[]
    })

    return members

book = add_book(2024001,"Python Programming","Jacob Zuma","Available")
member = add_member(1,"Anelisa Maleka")

print("Book:",book)
print("Member:",member)
